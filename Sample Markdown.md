# Roof Slope â€“ Labeling Instructions

## Overview

In this task, you will label roof panels using the polygon tool. There are 3 distinct types of panels:

class 1|class 2|class 3
:-----:|:-----:|:-----:
FLAT    | LOW | STEEP

## Instructions

1. Review the image to identify the roofs and pick a starting point.
1. Zoom in to get a better view before drawing any polygons.
1. Draw a separate polygon around **each roof panel**.
1. Zoom out to check the image carefully for any missed roof panels.
1. Lable around obstructions.

Labelbox will provide you with an image like the one above. This example shows the best-case scenario. There are four (oblique) images running from left to right that show the same houses from different directions. The rightmost image is a Google Streetview image. The Streetview image is provided as an additional resource to help you determine the roof slope. DO NOT LABEL THE STREETVIEW IMAGE
