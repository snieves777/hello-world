# Roof Slope â€“ Labeling Instructions


## Objective 
Label each roof panel on every roof visible as either FLAT, LOW, or STEEP.

## Orientation

Labelbox will provide you with an image like the one above. This example shows the best-case scenario. There are four (oblique) images running from left to right that show the same houses from different directions. The rightmost image is a Google Streetview image. The Streetview image is provided as an additional resource to help you determine the roof slope. DO NOT LABEL THE STREETVIEW IMAGE.
